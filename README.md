## Hi there 👋

### 🚀 About me

👧 I'm Diny Thomas, a Frontend focused Full Stack Web Developer passionate about creating clean, user-friendly web experiences. 

🔥 I love learning new technologies and applying them to build dynamic web applications. In 2021, I started with **JavaScript**, **React**, **Nodejs** and **Figma**. Then, in 2022, I added **TypeScript**, **GraphQl**, **Jest**, various **state management libraries** and **SASS** to my skill set. In 2023, I expanded my knowledge to include **C#**, **ASP.NET**, **Nextjs**, **Tailwind CSS** and bit into Cloud and Azure fundamentals.

😅 Outsid the world of tech, I started to pratice fitness through dance movements and looking forward to start playing badminton.

📚 I love reading books - travelougs and novels. Listening to music and a walk through the nature is a way to relax myself.

👁️ I'm currently seeking new opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to exciting web projects. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!
